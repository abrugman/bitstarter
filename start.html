	  <p>Stockety helps investors make more informed investment decisions on equity markets. Our algorithms calculate different historical valuation multiples and statistics, which are then displayed for interactive visualisation. We concentrate in EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenues, P/E and P/BV multiples. We will start covering the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average as of June 2013, and we would incorporate gradually further stocks from other indexes. Our goal is to cover most of the equity spectrum of developed capital markets and some emerging markets, and to incorporate further types of analysis, such as peer multiple comparisons.

		  Although peer comparison is one of the most common exercises made when comparing stocks in terms of value, historical evolution of such multiples offers an alternative spectrum of information. By identifying the level at which a given company trades in comparison of its history, one can understand, for instance, the effects of historical exogenous factors on the value of such stock. We believe that company fundamentals provide valuable information to an investor when making investment decisions, henceforth careful analysis of multiples should be one of the criteria used when taking financial decisions, from our point of view.

		  We are not a substitute of financial data providers and webpages. On the contrary, our goal is to contribute with analytical financial tools. We differentiate ourselves from current data providers and financial websites in three fronts: Quality of its database, detail in its analysis, and innovative charts. In addition, our purpose is to provide a valuable user experience with high quality visual design, without excessive advertisement, nor intrusive emails or publicity to potential subscribers. In a few words, we are an analytical tool rather than a descriptive a website.

		  Most public information about historical valuation multiples is either scarce, or available only to subscribers of a given service or institution. All of our data is of public domain. Our database, which is being constructed with public information, would start as of 1994, year in which electronic filings on EDGAR can be retrieved. Historical stock prices are being downloaded from YahooFinance.

In case this website finds enough traction and generates traffic that implies greater technological tasks and resources, one would expect to obtain revenues to fund operation from a small subscription fee, amongst others.

                  Valuation multiples are sufficient to invest in public equities?

                  No. It is well known that the value of a stock is a function of its future cash flows to equity and an appropiate discount factor that reflects their risk. Therefore, forecasting a company' financials is key for gaining visibility on fundamental value. However, history provides valuable information for forecasting reasonable assumptions, and here is where we contribute. We provide historical insight to check present and forward data. As well, although historical valuation multiples may be useful to some investors when analyzing stocks, it may be the case that they are not valuable to others. Multiples are difficult to control from inside management, and their magnitude over time is exposed to macroeconomic, technological and political risk, among others. For instance, buying a particular stock when its multiples are at a lower level than their historical averages does not guarantee that in the future such multiples would expand. Therefore, it is recommended to search and analyze information from other sources before making investment decisions. As well, you should at least study company financials and filings, shareholder reports, management, shareholder base, understand the industry in which the company competes, its evolution, and future prospects.

                  It may be not all the time. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of our analysis given that some of our data, such as EBITDA and daily outstanding stocks, amongst others, are not directly disclosed in public filings and hence, they need to be estimated by us. Estimated figures like EBITDA may differ from actual ones. However, our estimates use standard formulae and procedures normally used by the financial industry and hence, we are pretty confident of being close to real figures. Finally, it is important to mention that most of the financial information is obtained directly from EDGAR filings and is not estimated.

                  Our main challenge is to parse financial figures from public filings on a massive scale. Although such issues can be solved by purchasing the data from several financial data providers, we build our database with our own proprietary software and algorithms, EBITDA estimates, and other financial data directly from public filings. Parsing text files correctly is hard, especially when all accounting data changes from company to company, and from time to time in the same company. Therefore, yes, we do need to type data from filings and perform strict checks until we fully develop correct parsing algorithms.
