		  Although peer comparison is one of the most common exercises made when comparing stocks in terms of value, historical evolution of such multiples offers an alternative spectrum of information. By identifying the level at which a given company trades in comparison of its history, one can understand, for instance, the effects of historical exogenous factors on the value of such stock. We believe that company fundamentals provide valuable information to an investor when making investment decisions, henceforth careful analysis of multiples should be one of the criteria used when taking financial decisions, from our point of view.

                  It may be not all the time. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of our analysis given that some of our data, such as EBITDA, amongst others, are not directly disclosed in public filings and hence, they need to be estimated by us. Estimated figures like EBITDA may differ from actual ones. However, our estimates use standard formulae and procedures normally used by the financial industry. Finally, it is important to mention that most of the financial information is obtained directly from EDGAR filings and is not estimated.

		  1) No Investment Advice: The data on this website is for your information only. It does not constitute investment advice nor investment recommendation. We are not a registered investment advisor. All investment and financial data expressed here are from personal research and experience of the owners and are intended as educational material.
		  We only have access to public information about publicly traded companies, and this is not a place for receiving advice concerning investment decisions. We perform financial data research with generic information related to stocks. No content on the site constitutes - or should be understood as constituting - a recommendation to enter in any securities transactions. We do not provide personalized recommendations or views as to whether a stock or investment approach is suited to the financial needs of a specific individual.
		  The information provided by us should not be used as a substitute for suitable investment and product-related advice. Should you have any doubts about the meaning of the information provided herein, you should contact your financial advisor or any other independent professional advisor.
		  We are not regulated by any Financial Services Authority.
		  2) Do your Own Research: Our content is intended to be used and must be used for informational purposes only. It is very important to do your own analysis before making any investment based on your own personal circumstances. You should take independent financial advice from a professional in connection with, or independently research and verify, any information that you find here and wish to rely upon, whether for the purpose of making an investment decision or otherwise.
		  Although we present investment screens, the results should only be treated as candidates for further research, not as a buy list or set of recommendations. Where we offer valuation multiples, these are solely for informational and educational purposes so that you can start performing your own research. We would like to draw your attention that past performance is not a guide to future performance and therefore, history is just a part of an integral analysis regarding the potential value of a stock.
		  3) Information: We regularly check and update the data we used in our analysis. Despite due care, however, the data underlying this information may have changed in the period since the last review. We therefore accept no liability and offer no guarantee as to whether the information is up to date, correct or complete. We do not give any assurance that our analysis is without errors. Although best efforts are made to ensure that all information is accurate and up to date, un-intended errors and misprints may occur.
		  4) No reliance: Accordingly, we will not be liable, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, in respect of any damage, expense or other loss you may suffer arising out of such information or any reliance you may place upon such information.
